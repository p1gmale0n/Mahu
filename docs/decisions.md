# Decision History

| Date | Area | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-05-20 | Agent instructions | Keep `AGENTS.md` compact and omit unverifiable build/test commands until project manifests exist. | At the time of the decision, the repository had no app sources, manifests, README, or CI; speculative commands would mislead future agents. |
| 2026-05-20 | Documentation | Keep a basic README as the human-facing project overview and update it with behavior, setup, structure, and verification changes. | The user wants README to stay current, and future agents need a stable source for project status without reading only agent instructions. |
| 2026-05-20 | MVP scope | Build the first version around 20-20-20 defaults, icon-only status menu with Quit, config-file settings, fullscreen break overlay, countdown, and Skip. | This keeps the first implementation small while preserving extension seams for settings UI, launch at login, sleep/wake handling, and App Store release work. |
| 2026-05-20 | Project shape and config | Use a modern Xcode macOS app shape with SwiftUI lifecycle plus AppKit interop, and store config in `~/Library/Application Support/Mahu/config.json` with default fallback. | This follows macOS conventions while keeping the MVP simple and resilient to missing or broken user-edited config. |
| 2026-05-20 | Development workflow | Treat OpenCode sessions as planning/review by default; execute implementation separately with `ralphex` unless the user explicitly asks for edits. | This preserves the user's chosen development pattern and prevents agents from changing files when the expected output is a plan or task prompt. |
| 2026-05-20 | MVP implementation plan | Plan MVP implementation as a standard Xcode app target with focused modules and regular code-first tasks that still require tests before each next task. | This fits the `ralphex` execution workflow while keeping the plan small, verifiable, and App Store-aware. |
| 2026-05-20 | Project bootstrap | Hand-author the initial Xcode project files instead of introducing a project generator dependency. | The environment had Xcode but no `xcodegen` or `tuist`; a small checked-in project keeps bootstrap deterministic and lets later tasks use `xcodebuild` immediately. |
| 2026-05-20 | Config storage | Implement config loading through an injectable `ConfigStore` that resolves the real Application Support path in production and a temporary directory in tests. | The MVP needs the canonical `~/Library/Application Support/Mahu/config.json` location, but deterministic unit tests should not touch the real user config. |

## 2026-05-20 / Agent Instructions

**Date:** 2026-05-20

**Area:** Agent instructions

**Context:** At the time of the decision, the repository contained only `.memsearch/`; product constraints were provided by the user.

**Decision:** Create a compact `AGENTS.md` from user-provided Mahu requirements and explicitly avoid inventing build/test commands.

**Rationale:** Future agents need product invariants and implementation constraints, but unverified commands would create false confidence.

**Consequences:** Build, test, lint, and signing commands must be added after `Package.swift`, `.xcodeproj`, `.xcworkspace`, or CI config exists.

**Alternatives Considered:** Add generic Swift/Xcode commands; rejected because they are not verified in this repo.

## 2026-05-20 / Documentation

**Date:** 2026-05-20

**Area:** Documentation

**Context:** The project is still in bootstrap state, but needs a human-facing README with current purpose, constraints, and status.

**Decision:** Create `README.md` as the project overview and require updates when app behavior, structure, setup steps, or verification commands change.

**Rationale:** `AGENTS.md` is for agent operating guidance; README should remain the compact public project entrypoint.

**Consequences:** Future implementation changes that affect behavior or commands should update README in the same patch.

**Alternatives Considered:** Keep project information only in `AGENTS.md`; rejected because that file is agent-specific and not the right human-facing source.

## 2026-05-20 / MVP Scope

**Date:** 2026-05-20

**Area:** MVP scope

**Context:** The user clarified initial product behavior and explicitly deferred convenience features.

**Decision:** Use 20-20-20 defaults, allow skipping a break, keep settings in a manually editable config file, make the status item icon-only with a `Quit` menu action, and keep launch at login, settings UI, status countdown, sleep/wake reconciliation, and App Store packaging work as deferred features.

**Rationale:** The MVP should validate the core break-reminder behavior before adding UI and lifecycle complexity.

**Consequences:** The implementation should keep timer, config, status item, and overlay responsibilities separated so deferred features can be added without rewriting the core flow.

**Alternatives Considered:** Build settings UI, status countdown, and launch-at-login in the MVP; rejected to keep the first implementation focused on the core overlay behavior.

## 2026-05-20 / Project Shape and Config

**Date:** 2026-05-20

**Area:** Project shape and config

**Context:** The user does not have a strong project-format preference and asked to use current Apple/macOS conventions. The user also wants to manually edit the MVP config.

**Decision:** Use a standard modern Xcode macOS app shape with SwiftUI app lifecycle and AppKit interop for menu-bar and overlay behavior. Store config at `~/Library/Application Support/Mahu/config.json` with work and break durations in seconds.

**Rationale:** Xcode app targets are the normal path for a native macOS app and App Store packaging. Application Support is the conventional writable per-user location for app-owned configuration.

**Consequences:** Config loading must create a default file when missing and fall back to 20-20-20 defaults when invalid, without blocking the app.

**Alternatives Considered:** Use only a Swift package; rejected because app bundle metadata, Info.plist behavior, signing, and future App Store workflow fit Xcode targets better.

## 2026-05-20 / Development Workflow

**Date:** 2026-05-20

**Area:** Development workflow

**Context:** The user clarified that this chat is primarily for discussing and planning implementation, while actual implementation is performed separately with `ralphex`.

**Decision:** Future OpenCode sessions should default to planning, task prompts, reviews, and debugging guidance. Agents must not create, edit, or delete project files unless the user explicitly asks for repository changes in the current message.

**Rationale:** This keeps the workflow aligned with the user's chosen execution tool and avoids unintended repo mutations from planning conversations.

**Consequences:** When implementation is needed, produce clear `ralphex` tasks or plans unless the user explicitly delegates direct editing to OpenCode.

**Alternatives Considered:** Let OpenCode implement by default; rejected because it conflicts with the intended `ralphex`-driven development pattern.

## 2026-05-20 / MVP Implementation Plan

**Date:** 2026-05-20

**Area:** MVP implementation plan

**Context:** The user asked for an interactive implementation plan for the Mahu MVP, intended for later execution with `ralphex`.

**Decision:** Create `docs/plans/2026-05-20-mahu-mvp.md` using the recommended Xcode app target approach, focused module boundaries, and regular code-first implementation with tests required inside every task.

**Rationale:** The project has no executable manifest yet, so the plan must bootstrap the app first, then require verification and documentation updates as soon as commands become real.

**Consequences:** `ralphex` should execute the plan task-by-task, update checkboxes immediately, and add exact build/test commands to `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` after the Xcode project exists.

**Alternatives Considered:** Swift Package first or UI prototype first; rejected because they either add setup overhead or increase the chance of rewriting timer/config/overlay seams.

## 2026-05-20 / Project Bootstrap

**Date:** 2026-05-20

**Area:** Project bootstrap

**Context:** Task 1 required a real macOS Xcode app target with tests, but the environment did not include `xcodegen` or `tuist`.

**Decision:** Create and commit the initial `Mahu.xcodeproj`, scheme, app sources, and test target directly in the repository instead of adding a new generation tool.

**Rationale:** A hand-authored minimal project keeps the bootstrap small, avoids adding tooling before the app exists, and immediately enables verified `xcodebuild` commands for the next tasks.

**Consequences:** Future structural project changes must edit checked-in Xcode project files directly unless the team later adopts a generator intentionally.

**Alternatives Considered:** Add `xcodegen` or `tuist`; rejected because introducing and documenting a new project-generation dependency would add more moving parts than the MVP bootstrap needs.

## 2026-05-20 / Config Storage

**Date:** 2026-05-20

**Area:** Config storage

**Context:** Task 2 required reading and creating `~/Library/Application Support/Mahu/config.json` while also adding unit tests for missing-file creation, valid custom JSON, and invalid JSON fallback.

**Decision:** Implement `ConfigStore` as a small Foundation-based type with an injectable base Application Support directory, defaulting to the real user directory in production and allowing tests to substitute a temporary directory.

**Rationale:** This preserves the required production path without making tests mutate the real user environment or rely on brittle filesystem cleanup.

**Consequences:** Future config-related tests can stay fast and deterministic; app wiring can construct `ConfigStore()` with defaults and get the correct macOS path automatically.

**Alternatives Considered:** Hardcode the real home-directory path everywhere or mock filesystem behavior more heavily; rejected because the first risks touching real user data during tests and the second adds unnecessary abstraction for the MVP.
